"Like all of you, I have had difficulty getting in here today, that started with my signing on the bail in Norfolk - my 323rd day - and ended with getting through the kettling. But there's many people who haven't yet been able to get through - these guys over here.And I hope that they will be able to, and you will not accept the kettling. I've always wanted to say - we are all individual, and all of us are very naughty boys and girls. But to be serious, what is happening here today is a culmination of dreams that many people all over the world have worked towards. From Cairo to London. What we face today is the systematized destruction of the Rule of Law. People are being laundered through Guantanamo Bay to evade the Rule of Law, and money is being laundered through the Cayman Islands and London to evade the Rule of Law. This movement is not about the destruction of Law; It is about the construction of Law. Thank you."

*****

I was very curious as a child, always asking why, and always wanting to overcome barriers to knowing, which meant that by the time I was around fifteen I was breaking encryption systems that were used to stop people sharing software, and then, later on, breaking systems that were used to hide information in government computers. Australia was a very provincial place before the internet, and it was a great delight to be able to get out, intellectually, into the wider world, to tunnel through it and understand it. For someone who was young and relatively removed from the rest of the world, to be able to enter the depths of the Pentagonâ€™s Eighth Command at the age of seventeen was a liberating experience. But our group, which centered on the underground magazine I founded was raided by the Federal Police. It was a big operation. But I thought that I needed to share this wealth that I had discovered about the world with people, to give knowledge to people, and so following that I set up the first part of the internet industry in Australia. I spent a number of years bringing the internet to the people through my free speech ISP and then began to look for something with a new intellectual challenge.
