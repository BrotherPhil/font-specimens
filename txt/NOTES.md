## Definition: 

What is a font specimen sheet?

A font specimen sheet usually displays all characters of a font, at different point sizes, paragraph settings, leaded or tracked. Upper Case and Lower Case. It should include formal identification of the font: its name, classification, designer/typographer, the foundry and a demonstrated showing of ‘font family’ characteristics weights/shade in print.
